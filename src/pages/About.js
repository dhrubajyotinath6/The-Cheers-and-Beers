        All things cocktail-related are the focus of <strong>The Cheers and Beers!</strong>
        Our cocktails are essentially mixed drinks that are frequently produced 
        with a distilled liquor as their foundation ingredient 
        (such as arrack, brandy, cacha√ßa, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, or whiskey).
        It is afterwards combined with additional ingredients or garnishes.
        Wine, beer, or sweetened liqueurs can alternatively be used as the foundation or added.
        The beverage is known as a beer cocktail when beer is one of the ingredients.
        Furthermore, one or more types of juice are frequently included in our drinks.
        Spices or other flavourings, fruit, honey, milk or cream, or milk.
